==============
Testing To-do:
==============

(somewhat in order of importance)
- Test motion controller
- Test raw joystick motion

- Tune joystick motion controller
- Tune lift motion controller

- Test positioner
- Test data tables

- Work on vision

======
Notes:
======

- Potential additional drive functions:
	- Line up with different axes
	- Line up with boxes using camera
	- Quick spin 180Â°
	- 


==================
Current Functions:
==================

- Robot positioning calculator
	- Dependent on gyroscope

- Motion controller
	- PI (PID) control, I range
		- D control incomplete due to necessary fancy code for it to work
	- Trapezoidal motion profiling
		- Velocity limiting, acceleration/deceleration limiting
		- Data tables of acceleration/power for tuning
			- Data recording for tables, can be saved
		
- Sensor data recording for debugging, saved to file

- Log recording, saved to file

- Sensor dependencies system
	- Keeps track if different sensors are unavailable
	
- Autonomous moving function
	- Uses motion controller for linear and angular error independently
	- Dependent on gyroscope
	
- Joystick control
	- Arcade mode using motion controller
		- Dependent on gyroscope
	- Arcade mode raw
		- No motion controlling, direct joystick to motor controlling
			- Has angular sensitivity value
	- Tank mode raw
		- No motion controlling, completely direct joystick to motors
	- Mecanum control (INCOMPLETE)

- 2015 Vision code
	- Outputs camera vision to driver station
	- Detects retroreflective tape, calculates position of respective yellow totes (INCOMPLETE)
		- Displays found tape rectangles on driver station
	- Detects green bins (INCOMPLETE)

- Wrappers for SmartDashboard inputs/outputs
